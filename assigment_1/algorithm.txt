Include the necessary C++ standard libraries:

iostream: for input and output operations.
fstream: for file input/output operations.
sstream: for string stream operations.
vector: for using a 2D vector.
bits/stdc++.h: This header includes commonly used headers like iostream, fstream, etc.
Define the main function.

Declare a fstream object named file to work with the input file.

Open the file "file.txt" in read-only mode (ios::in) using file. Check if the file is successfully opened:

If the file is open, print "file successfully opened."
If the file is not open, print "file is not opened."
Declare a 2D vector named vec to store the words read from the file.

Initialize an integer variable i to keep track of the current row in the 2D vector.

Declare a string variable line to store each line read from the file.

Use a while loop to read the file line by line until the end of the file is reached:
a. Add an empty vector to the 2D vector vec to create a new row.
b. Create a stringstream object str from the line to tokenize the line into words.
c. Declare a string variable word to store each word.
d. Use a while loop to extract words from the str and push them into the current row of vec.

Use nested for loops to print the contents of the 2D vector:
a. Iterate over the rows (i) of the vector.
b. Iterate over the columns (j) within each row and print each word followed by a space.
c. Increment the count variable to keep track of the number of words in the file.
d. Print a newline character after each row to separate rows.

Print the total number of words in the file using the count variable.

Close the file using file.close().

End the main function and return 0 to indicate successful program execution.
